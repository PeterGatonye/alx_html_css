# Headphones Web Page

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Frontend curriculum. The goal was to recreate a webpage based on a professional Figma design created by Nicolas Philippot. The page is fully responsive, accessible, and built entirely with HTML and CSS — no JavaScript or external CSS frameworks were used.

## Features
- Pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma design
- Responsive design for mobile (screens ≤ 480px)
- Hover and active states for links and buttons
- Layout width constrained to max 1000px and centered
- Fonts used: Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Keyboard-navigable links and buttons
- ARIA roles where appropriate
- High contrast for readability

## Interactions
- Hover/active state for links: `#FF6565`
- Hover/active state for buttons: `opacity: 0.9`

## Responsive Design
- Switches to mobile layout at screen width ≤ 480px
- Fully fluid design using flexbox and media queries
